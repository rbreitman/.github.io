		<h1>More about Roberto </h1>
		<h2>Basic Bio:</h2>
		<p>In 1998 Roberto was born in Rio de Janeiro Brazil where he would live with his parents and 2 brothers for the first 18 years of his life. There he attended the American School of Rio were he  participated in school musicals as a sax player, and played on the football team. Having finished high-school, Roberto moved to Medford Massachusetts int eh United States to attend Tufts university, where he is a junior pursuing a double major in Computer Science and International Relations.</p>



		
		<h2>Football Career:</h2>
		<p>	Like every young Brazilian boy, Roberto once dreamed of being a footballer.
	    This is how he failed.</p>
		<p>	Roberto started  
		footballing at Zero Esporte, a world renown after-school program. At 11 he 
		transitioned to his school team at the American School of Rio, immediately making a big
		impact as 3rd alternate goalkeeper. By 14 he had fought his way to 2nd alternate, a 
		position he would hold to the end of his middle school career. In Highschool Roberto made
	 	an imediate splash, as an injury to the trying keeper have a Roberto a shot at the starting
	  	job. Roberto promptly pushed that shot away from the goal as a good goalkeeper should, 
		returning to the bench just 2 weeks later. Following a slow assent to starting keeper,
	 	Roberto was forced to hang his jersey and leave the Rio leagues of his youth. Today
	  	Roberto is a doubtless starter in the Tufts university Intermural league, where
	  	he has built a reputation under the nickname “that Brazilian dude”.
	    The future is bright. </p>
